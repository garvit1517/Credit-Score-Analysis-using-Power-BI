This project aims to provide in depth analysis of credit inquiries and loan behaviours which are separated by annual income, age groups, credit history age and occupation. The goal of this visualization is to facilitate decision-making by identifying relationships between certain demographics and financial factors. Finding these relationships will allow for better financial solutions and deeper understandings on each customer demographic.
